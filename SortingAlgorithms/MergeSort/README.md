![Merge Sort](merge_sort.png)

Merge Sort Algorithm is a classic ‘Divide and Conquer’ algorithm where the list to be sorted is divided into smaller parts, sorted individually, and then merged back together.

The ‘Divide and Conquer’ concept consists of three key principles:

1. Divide the problem into multiple subproblems.
2. Solve the subproblems independently.
3. Merge the solved subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem.
